create a dict grouping all similar items by name
maybe if more than two words are the same or something
if like food items don't have category and type filled in, copy them from similarly grouped food items
Maybe start by grouping food items by category and type and printing them out to see range of entries
save as a new file
Create a new file which assembles the food items, or a file for the cleaner functions, but that imports the food item assembler
