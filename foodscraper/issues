1. beautiful soup object seems to have problems finding tags 'subnav', I'm thinking it's because of the javascript/etc in the file. Printing out get_text() gives the wrong text so the parsing is having errors somewhere

2. currently trying to collect the relevant html tags into a soup object so it can be accessed programmaticaly and used to build a referential tree structure
